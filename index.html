    <h2> *Key Features of the Internet:</h2>
    <p>1. Global Connectivity: The Internet connects billions of devices worldwide, allowing users to communicate, share
        information, and access services.
        2. Decentralized: The Internet is a decentralized system, meaning that there is no single central authority
        controlling it.
        3. Open Standards: The Internet uses open standards and protocols, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP, which enable
        different devices and systems to communicate with each other.
        4. Scalability: The Internet is designed to be scalable, allowing it to grow and adapt to increasing demands and
        new technologies.</p>
    <h3> *How the internet works:</h3>
    <p>
        1. Devices: Users access the Internet using devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets.
        2. Networks: Devices connect to local networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet, which provide access to the Internet.
        3. Routers: Networks are connected to routers, which forward data packets between networks.
        4. Servers: Data is stored on servers, which are powerful computers that provide access to websites, services,
        and applications.
        5. Protocols: Data is transmitted using standardized protocols, such as HTTP and FTP, which ensure that data is
        delivered correctly and efficiently.</p>
